# # Problem statement
# 
# Create famous 'Frog leap' puzzle game. Try completing the game before starting to get an idea about its working.
# [Demonstration](https://www.neok12.com/games/leap-froggies/leap-froggies.htm).
# 
# 
# ### Rules ###
# 1. The left set of frogs can only move right, the right set of frogs can only move left.
# 2. Frogs can move forward one space, or move two spaces by jumping over another frog from opposite side.
# 3. The puzzle is solved when the two sets of frogs have switched positions.
# 
# 
# ## Steps to solve the problem:
# ### Step1:-
# - Display green and brown frogs on the left and right sides initially.
# 
# Initial Display :-  
# ```
# [ 0 ,  1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  6 ]
# ['G', 'G', 'G', '-', 'B', 'B', 'B']
# ```
# <br>
# Here 'G' represents Green frogs on the left side and 'B' represents brown frogs on the right side. The '-' defines the position of empty leaf.
# (You can change display according to your imagination or convinience)
# 
# ### Step2:-
# Accept positions of the frog that you want to move.<br>
# Example: If we enter position 2 then the game will look like this:-
# ```
# [ 0 ,  1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  6 ]
# ['G', 'G', '-', 'G', 'B', 'B', 'B']
# ```
# 
# ### Step3:- ###
# Define Invalid moves and add conditional 'if' statements accordingly
# #### Rules
# 1. Entered position should be between 0 to 6. Or a character 'q' to quit the game.
# 2. Entered position cannot be the position of empty leaf.
# 3. If the selected frog position cannot perform the contraints given in rule 2 then the move is invalid.
# 
# ### Step4:-
# Make the appropriate move by changing the game display.

# ## Step 1
# First create a list `positions` which contains the characters 'G','B' and '-' in the same sequence as given in the initial display state.

# In[5]:


### Search the python Src Unicode version of Frog.
a=u"\U0001F438"
a1=u"\U0001F422"
b='-'
### Make a list using the frog emoji and a blank[Acc to our Game Theme] 
l=[a1,a1,a1,b,a,a,a]


# Now print this string ```[ 0 ,  1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  6 ]``` and after that print the list `positions`

# In[6]:


### print the list
print(l)


# Take position input from user and write a message as `"Press q to quit else \nEnter position of piece:"`.

# In[7]:


### To quit or enter the position of piece.
n=input("Press q to quit else\n Enter position of piece:")


# Now the taken input is in string format. So first check if the input is `'q'` character. If input is `'q'` then the person is quiting the game so print `'You Lose'`.

# In[8]:


### If input is q then the person lost the game and play from the start.
if n=='q':
    print("you lose")


# Next if input character is not `'q'` then it has to be some integer. so convert input to integer format.

# In[9]:


### If input is not 'q' then convert the string into Integer.
if n!='q':
    n=int(n)
    print(n)


# ## Step 2
# Now we have to check validity of the selected positions or move.<br>
# If the entered number isn't between 0 and 6, then print 'Invalid move'.

# In[10]:


### If input is not in between "0 to 6" it is invalid.
if n<0 and n>6:
    print("Invalid Move")
    


# A frog should be present on the selected position to make a move. If leaf is selected then it doesn't make sense. Therefore, if entered postition is same as the postition of empty leaf then the move is invalid and print `Invalid Move`

# In[11]:


### If selected position is blank it is invalid.
if l[n]=='-':
    print("Invalid Move")
    


# Initialize a variable named `pos2` at value 0, to store the index of empty leaf, so that we can use it later.

# In[12]:


### initializing "pos2" to "zero"
pos2=0
        


# ```   
#     Check if the selected frog is 'G':
#   
#         (Inside if when it's 'G'. As 'G' is selected frog can move to right only.)
#         
#         ‚ùócondition 1
# 
#         If **selected_position + 1** is less than or equal to 6 and **curent_position + 1** contains '-'
#         then it's a valid move and store that postion in `pos2`.
#         
#         ‚ùócondition2
# 
#         Else if **selected_position + 2** is less than or equal to 6 and if **current_position + 2**
#         contains '-' and if **selected_position + 1** contains 'B' then it's a valid move  and store that postion in `pos2`.
#         
#         ‚ùócondition3:
# 
#         Else remainig all are invalid, so print `Invalid Move`
#       
# ```

#         If **selected_position - 1** is more than or equal to 0 and **curent_position - 1** contains '-' then

# Now the game should keep running until the player quits, so place all conditional statements inside an infinite loop.<br>

# 3. If player wins the game we have to `break` the loop.
